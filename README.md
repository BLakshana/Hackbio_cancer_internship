<p align="center"> HackBio is a global bioinformatics internship that provides hands-on experience in genomics and computational biology, helping participants build practical skills through real-world projects and collaborative learning.</p>

<h2> STAGE 0 </h2>

**TASK** : ESSAY WRITING ON TOPIC "*Drug resistance in cancer.*"

**Skills Developed** : Scientific Writing, Markdown Language.

The task provided insights into the different types of resistance in cancer and the mechanisms underlying drug resistance.

<h2> STAGE 1 </h2>

**TASK** : REVIEW THE PAPER "*Whole-Genome Sequencing Accurately Identifies Resistance to Extended Spectrum β-Lactams for Major Gram-Negative Bacterial Pathogens.*"

**Skills developed** : Scientific Writing, Presentation skills.

The task enhanced understanding of the significance of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for identifying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinical settings and how its evolution could improve the feasibility of genome-wide analysis in clinical microbiology.

<h2> STAGE 2 </h2>

**TASK** : DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION OF "*Pipeline of antimicrobial agents in clinical development (WHO - Nov 2021).*"

**Skills developed** : Data Analysis and Visualization, R (Programming language).

The pipeline included information on drug type, clinical development phase, activity against pathogens, innovativeness, route of administration, antibiotic class, and developers of various drug candidates targeting WHO-identified bacterial priority pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Clostridium difficile. This task involved analyzing, visualizing, and presenting the data from the pipeline in the form of infographics.
