<h2> STAGE 0 </h2>

**TASK** : ESSAY WRITING ON TOPIC "*Drug resistance in cancer*"

**Skills Developed** : Scientific Writing, Markdown Language.

The task provided insights into the different types of resistance in cancer and the mechanisms underlying drug resistance.

<h2> STAGE 1 </h2>

**TASK** : REVIEW THE PAPER "*Whole-Genome Sequencing Accurately Identifies Resistance to Extended Spectrum Î²-Lactams for Major Gram-Negative Bacterial Pathogens*"

**Skills developed** : Scientific Writing, Presentation skills.

The task enhanced understanding of the significance of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for identifying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinical settings and how its evolution could improve the feasibility of genome-wide analysis in clinical microbiology.

<h2> STAGE 2 </h2>

**TASK** : DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION OF "*Pipeline of antimicrobial agents in clinical development (WHO - Nov 2021)*"

The task offered opportunity to upskill in data-visualization.
**Skills developed** : Scientific Writing, Presentation skills.
