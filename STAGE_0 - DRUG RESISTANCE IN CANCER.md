<!--StartFragment-->   **DRUG RESISTANCE IN CANCER**<!--EndFragment-->

****

Drug resistance poses a serious threat in cancer treatment, significantly impacting the effectiveness of drugs. As cancer cells evolve and advance, they develop mechanisms to evade the effects of therapeutic agents, leading to treatment failure and disease progression. Initially, the cell exhibits resistance towards a single chemotherapeutic agent, which then gradually progresses to other agents with similar structures, leading to multidrug resistance. Understanding the drug resistance mechanism is essential for developing strategies that can be employed to address and overcome drug resistance. This essay will briefly discuss types of resistance in cancer and different mechanisms by which the resistance is developed.

 

**TYPES OF RESISTANCE IN CANCER**:

The drug resistance in cancer is broadly classified into two types, the intrinsic and the extrinsic resistance. 

**Innate/Intrinsic resistance**:

It is a type of resistance that pre-exists before treatment. Possible causes are (i) genetic alteration and (ii) activation of defense mechanisms against environmental toxins. E.g., cisplatin treatment in gastric cancer resulted in a low survival rate of HER2/Snail double-positive patients. This is because the upregulation of Snail transcription factor driven by overexpression of the HER2 gene induced a morphological change similar to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which makes cancer cells more resistant.

**Acquired/Extrinsic resistance**:

It is a type of resistance that is developed over time when exposed to drugs during treatment. Possible causes are (i) mutation-mediated modification in drug targets and (ii) changes in the tumor microenvironment. E.g., resistance to methotrexate, a drug that inhibits the DHFR enzyme that is critical for DNA synthesis, is conferred by DHFR gene amplification and, even more importantly, amplification of the mdr1 gene, encoding a membrane-associated drug efflux pump, leading to multidrug resistance, which enables malignant cells to become resistant to a wide range of unrelated drugs.

**MECHANISMS OF DRUG RESISTANCE**:

The mechanisms are classified into 6 distinct categories and are often found to occur in combination, which makes them highly complex. They are alteration of drug targets, drug efflux pump, repair of DNA damage, cell death inhibition, altered proliferation and drug inactivation. Among these, 3 will be discussed with examples.

**Alteration of drug targets**:

Altering the target region through rapid reduction in target gene expression and mutation are the two common approaches that result in resistance development and reduction in drug efficacy. E.g., preventing doxorubicin from binding to topoisomerase ii and thus preventing cancer cell death.

**Drug efflux pump**:

The most common and well studied resistance mechanism, where pumps eject toxins to protect cells. In cancer cells, the anti-cancer drugs are considered as toxins, thus the expression of the efflux pump is upregulated by cancer cells, resulting in resistance to the drug. E.g., ABC transporters (ATP binding cassette) are found in the transmembrane of both healthy and cancer cells to eject the toxic drug, thus rendering the cell resistance. 

**Repair of DNA damage**:

To prevent cell death due to the DNA damage inflicted by drugs, the cancer cells enhance the ability to repair the damage and survive. E.g., breast cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation depend on PARP for the repair mechanism. Inhibition of PARP enzymes can lead to cell death due to defective homologous recombination and thus causes cell death. However, resistance can develop when cancer cells acquire secondary mutations that restore BRCA function or when they upregulate other DNA repair pathways like non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). This restoration of DNA repair capability allows the cancer cells to survive and results in disease progression.

**CONCLUSION**:

Combating drug resistance requires a multifaceted approach. Several strategies like polychemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunological therapy and personalized medicines are currently employed to overcome or to be more precise delay the development of resistance. Continued research and innovation are essential to advance our ability to address drug resistance and enhance cancer treatment.
