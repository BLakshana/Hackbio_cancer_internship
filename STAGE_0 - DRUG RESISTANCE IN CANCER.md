**DRUG RESISTANCE IN CANCER**

****

Drug resistance poses a serious threat in cancer treatment, significantly impacting the effectiveness of drugs. As cancer cells evolve and advance, they develop mechanisms to evade the effects of therapeutic agents, leading to treatment failure and disease progression. Understanding the drug resistance mechanism is essential for developing strategies that can be employed to address and overcome drug resistance. This essay will briefly discuss types of resistance in cancer and different mechanisms of resistance development.


**Types of resistance**

****

***Innate/Intrinsic resistance***: It is a type of resistance that pre-exists before treatment. Possible causes (i) genetic alteration and (ii) activation of defense mechanisms against environmental toxins. E.g., cisplatin treatment in gastric cancer resulted in a low survival rate of HER2/Snail double-positive patients, because the upregulation of Snail transcription factor driven by overexpression of the HER2 gene induced morphological changes, which makes cancer cells more resistant.

***Acquired/Extrinsic resistance***: It is a type of resistance that is developed over time when exposed to drugs during treatment. Possible causes (i) mutation-mediated modification in drug targets and (ii) changes in the tumor microenvironment. E.g., resistance to methotrexate, a drug that inhibits the DHFR enzyme that is critical for DNA synthesis, is conferred by DHFR gene amplification,  which enables malignant cells to become resistant to a wide range of unrelated drugs.


**Mechansism of drug resistance**

****

Drug targets alteration, efflux pump, DNA damage repair, cell death inhibition, altered proliferation and drug inactivation are the six resistance mechanism, among which two are discussed.

***Drug targets alteration***: Altering the target region through rapid reduction in target gene expression and mutation are the two approaches that induce resistance development. E.g., preventing doxorubicin from binding to topoisomerase ii and thus preventing cancer cell death.

***Repair of DNA damage***: To prevent cell death due to the DNA damage inflicted by drugs, the cancer cells enhance the ability to repair the damage and survive. E.g., breast cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation depend on PARP for the repair mechanism. Inhibition of PARP enzymes can lead to cell death due to defective homologous recombination and thus causes cell death. However, resistance is developed when cancer cells acquire secondary mutations that restore BRCA function or other DNA repair pathways upregulate.


**Conclusion**

****

Combating drug resistance requires a multifaceted approach. Several strategies like polychemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunological therapy and personalized medicines are currently employed to overcome or delay the development of resistance. Continued research and innovation are essential to advance our ability to address drug resistance and enhance cancer treatment.
